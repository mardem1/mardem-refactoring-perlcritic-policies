=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Mardem - Perl-Critic policies for simple and isolated Refactoring-Support.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Perl-Crictic Policy-Modules should help where to start a safe
refactoring in old leagacy Perl code.

The McCabe complexity check within the standard Perl-Critic Module are a good
overall starting point see:

=over 4

=item * L<Perl::Critic::Policy::Modules::ProhibitExcessMainComplexity>

=item * L<Perl::Critic::Policy::Subroutines::ProhibitExcessComplexity>

=back

but these are for some bigger scans, so these new policies should check (or begin) in smaller chunks:

=head2 L<Perl::Critic::Policy::Mardem::ProhibitReturnBooleanAsInt>

return boolean as int "return 1;"

=head2 L<Perl::Critic::Policy::Mardem::ProhibitConditionComplexity>

condition complexity "if/while/for/... (...){}"

=head2 L<Perl::Critic::Policy::Mardem::ProhibitManyConditionsInSub>

subs has many conditionals "if, while, for, ..."

=head2 L<Perl::Critic::Policy::Mardem::ProhibitLargeBlock>

large code block as statement count "{...}"

=head2 L<Perl::Critic::Policy::Mardem::ProhibitBlockComplexity>

code block complexity "{...}"

=head2 L<Perl::Critic::Policy::Mardem::ProhibitLargeSub>

large subs as statement count

=head1 AFFILIATION
