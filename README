DESCRIPTION

Perl-Critic Policies for simple and isolated Refactoring-Support.

This Perl-Crictic Policy-Modules should help where to start a safe
refactoring in old leagacy Perl code.

The McCabe complexity check within the standard Perl-Critic Module are a good
overall starting point see:

* Perl::Critic::Policy::Modules::ProhibitExcessMainComplexity
* Perl::Critic::Policy::Subroutines::ProhibitExcessComplexity

but these are for some bigger scans, so these new policies should check (or begin) in smaller chunks:

* ProhibitReturnBooleanAsInt - return boolean as int "return 1;"
* ProhibitConditionComplexity - condition complexity "if/while/for/... (...){}"
* ProhibitManyConditionsInSub - subs has many conditionals "if, while, for, ..."
* ProhibitLargeBlock - large code block as statement count "{...}"
* ProhibitBlockComplexity - code block complexity "{...}"
* ProhibitLargeSub - large subs as statement count
* ProhibitLargeFile - large files as line count
* ProhibitFileSize - large files as byte or char count
